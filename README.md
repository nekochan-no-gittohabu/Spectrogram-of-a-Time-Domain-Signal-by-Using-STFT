# Spectrogram-of-a-Time-Domain-Signal-by-Using-STFT

The aim of this project is to obtain the spectrogram of a time-domain signal by using its Short Time Fourier Transform(STFT). A GUI which can be used to enter the STFT parameters, input signal type, and the desired output graphs, has been provided. Once these parameters have been selected user can obtain the time-domain, frequency-domain plots, and the spectrogram of the input signal.
